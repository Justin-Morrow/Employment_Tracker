## Description

According to Wikipedia "A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request–response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web—most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server.

A content management system (CMS) is computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content (content management). A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM)."

The Employee Tracker project is an assignment that asks for the web developer to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and create a database about their roles at the company. When the application begins, the user will be presented with a few choices, including, view the departments, view all the employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee's information.

Because this application isn't deployed, a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing will be required.
